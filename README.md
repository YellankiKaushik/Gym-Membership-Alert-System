## 🔔 Core USP — Admin Expiry Alert Engine

This is the **key differentiator** of the project.

The system includes a **fully automated admin-only email alert engine** that proactively informs the gym owner about expiring memberships.

### ✅ What It Does

- Automatically checks membership expiry dates
- Sends alerts **only to the admin email**
- Triggers alerts when a membership:
  - Expires today
  - Expires tomorrow
  - Expires in 2 days
  - Is already expired
- Sends **one-time notification per member**
- No duplicate emails
- No third-party services

### ✅ Why This Matters

Admins don’t need to:

- Open spreadsheets
- Manually check expiry dates
- Remember renewals

**USP statement for demos:**

> “The system proactively informs the admin before revenue is lost.”

## ⏱️ How Email Automation Works

- Backend runs on **Google Apps Script**
- A **time-based trigger** executes daily
- Trigger calls:
checkMembershipExpiries()

- Script reads Google Sheets data
- Sends alert email if conditions match
- Marks rows as “notified” to avoid duplicate alerts

⚠️ **Backend code is intentionally not inside GitHub**  
It runs securely inside Google Apps Script and connects directly to Google Sheets.
